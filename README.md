## :wave: Introduction

This repository is a place to publish reports on technical projects funded by the Polkadot and Kusama [Treasury](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury). The goal is to establish a transparent and objective reporting system that helps the community to make educated decisions about these projects and their progress. It’s based on the [Grant Milestone Delivery repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery). It’s encouraged to publish the reports not only as part of the repository but also on various community sides. However, Git helps to work together on the reports in a fully transparent way that let you easily track all the changes and edits.  

## :pencil: Guidelines

Reports need to: 
- be based on the [report-template](reports/report-template.md) 
- be fact-based and as objective as possible 
- contain no recommendations regarding potential funding decision 
- list all promised deliveries
